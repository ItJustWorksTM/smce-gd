Steps to Compile Sketch

2.Save a sketch to a folder, the sketch name ".ino" file and the foldername should be same.
Example Sketch 
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    Serial.println("Hello world!");
}

void loop() {
    Serial.println("This will get printed every second!");
    delay(1000);
}
3.Click on the + Add new button and navigate to the location of your previously created sketch
4.Click on the compile button 
5.To view the actions occuring at backend, click on the log button. The same screen will help to know why the compilation failed
6.Once compiled, hit start, you will see a car has appeared and the attachment list has populated.
7.Open the Serial window on the bottom left; you should see text being printed out.
8.To stop the sketch press Stop; the window won't disappear so you can restart the sketch immediately. 
Note that once a sketch is compiled you can reuse it in multiple boards, but if you decide to recompile a sketch all active boards running that sketch get stopped.
